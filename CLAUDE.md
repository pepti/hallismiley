# Orange Smiley — public site (orangesmiley.is)

The **public instance** of Orange Smiley ehf.: marketing site + seed of the customer portal, for the software agency / ERP-replacement business serving Icelandic SMBs. **This is NOT a customer migration** — it is the company's own site, dogfooding the site factory.

## Company/product split (Halli, 2026-08-22)

- **Orange Smiley = the company**; THIS repo/site is the **company site**: what the company does + its products (content pass = roadmap R1, not yet done — the current /thjonusta tier matrix eventually moves to the product site).
- **Rekstrarkerfið = the product** — ONE product for all: one shared core for every customer + per-customer custom features as AI-built/AI-maintained flagged modules, managed via the MCP connector (feature requests flow through the same AI workflow). Positioning: against fit-everyone standard ERP.
- **Canonical product core = sibling repo `C:\Users\Notandi\claude\Projects\rekstrarkerfid`** (scaffolded from the base 2026-08-22; serves rekstrarkerfi.is). Customers are generated from IT; HalliProjects retires as upstream after the transition (criteria in `company/REKSTRARKERFI-PLAN.md` §8).
- Strategy docs: `company/REKSTRARKERFI-PLAN.md` (product plan + roadmap R0–R8) and `company/REKSTRARKERFI-BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS.md` (product-site build brief); company plan §1/§4/§7 rewritten same day.

- **Owner**: Halli. Business plan: `company/ORANGE-SMILEY-PLAN.md` (offering/tiers §1, instance architecture §4, targets §7). Build brief: `company/CLAUDE-CODE-BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Both live in the gitignored `company/` folder in this repo, alongside `COMPANY-LOG.md` and `ORANGE-SMILEY-WEBSITE-PLAN.md`.
- **Product name** (Halli, 2026-08-20): **Rekstrarkerfi** is the ASCII/technical form — domain `rekstrarkerfi.is` (registered, with IDN `rekstrarkerfið.is` to 301 to it), slugs, identifiers. **"Rekstrarkerfið"** (definite form) is what every human-facing surface says: nav lockup, page titles, ads. The COMPANY stays Orange Smiley ehf. — footer, legal pages, /um-okkur, Organization JSON-LD. Logo unchanged.
- **Provenance**: scaffolded 2026-08-09 from the HalliProjects base — now at `C:\Users\Notandi\claude\Projects\hallismiley` (folder renamed 2026-08-23) — at base rev **`562c637`** by site-factory.
- **Estate map**: `C:\Users\Notandi\claude\Projects\README.md` orients any session across all sibling repos (roles, remotes, shared policies).
- **Deploy target**: company Azure tenant (exists since 2026-08-12; company identity details in gitignored `company/COMPANY-LOG.md`) — **no provisioning or deploy without Halli's explicit go-ahead**. ENHANCEMENTS #1 is done (2026-08-19): `deploy.yml` is neutralized, so pushing the repo is safe.

## ⚠ Do NOT run /strip-base

Halli's explicit instruction: **all base features and data models stay** — shop/cart/checkout/orders, admin + RBAC, bookkeeping suite, projects, news, party, user system, themes, i18n, Stripe, everything. Portfolio surfaces that don't fit the business (party, personal bio/news presentation) are *hidden from nav/SSR/sitemap but left functional* at their routes. Disposition of each module is decided via `ENHANCEMENTS.md` proposals with Halli's sign-off — never by deletion during the build.

## Stack (inherited — invariants, do not change)

- Express 4.x, CommonJS server. PostgreSQL via `pg` (dev DB `orangesmiley`, test DB `orangesmiley_test`, user postgres/postgres).
- Vanilla JS SPA frontend — **no React/Vue/Svelte, no bundler**.
- Lucia v3 sessions. One auth system only. (The old "RS256 JWT" line was boilerplate — no JWT code exists; verified 2026-08-22.)
- Migrations are **entries appended to the array in `server/config/schema.js`** (applied by `npm run migrate` / at boot); the `NNN_name.sql` files under `server/migrations/` are reference copies. Never edit an applied entry (`/migration-new` to add).
- Consistent error envelope on all routes; pino (no console.log); typed errors → central middleware.
- Security: helmet, csrf-csrf, hpp, express-rate-limit, sanitize-html, RBAC role checks. Tighten, don't loosen.
- **Multi-theme engine:** `public/css/themes.css` + render-blocking `theme-boot.js`, `html[data-theme]` (`classic` default). Re-brand = re-hue token *values*, keep the machinery.
- Tests: Jest integration (real Postgres, no pg mocks) + Playwright e2e. Adapt inherited specs, never delete them.
- i18n: EN + IS JSON locale files; `npm run check:i18n` before pushing translation changes. Icelandic is the primary/default visitor locale (job 2); EN mirrors it. Language-switcher choice lives in the **`locale_choice`** cookie.
- Transactional email sender = **`EMAIL_FROM`** in `.env` (set to placeholder `info@orangesmiley.is` — base default is halli@hallismiley.is, never use it here).

Full rules: `.claude/rules/stack-invariants.md` (auto-loaded). Two footguns worth repeating here: Express 5 catch-alls are `app.get('/{*splat}', …)` — keep the braces, `'/*splat'` stops matching `/`; and Node 26 is Current-not-LTS — the Docker digest and ci.yml node-version move TOGETHER, and dependabot must not major-bump the base image on its own.

## Project rules

- Read-only references — never modify: `C:\Users\Notandi\claude\Projects\icelandicstore` (customer #1's live system) and `C:\Users\Notandi\claude\Projects\hallismiley` (the HalliProjects base; folder renamed from `HalliProjects` 2026-08-23). The base was temporarily writable for the 2026-08-19 base-upgrade program (13 PRs, ledger: site-factory/BASE-SYNC.md); that program is closed and the read-only rule is back in force — base writes need Halli's explicit say-so again.
- One feature branch + worktree per chunk; every chunk ends with lint + `check:i18n` + tests green, then merges to main (Halli reviews history post-hoc — his decision 2026-08-09).
- **Halli approves before the fact**: all copy and pricing (draft natively in Icelandic, mark `DRAFT`), anything in `ENHANCEMENTS.md` before implementation, and any deploy.
- Prices on `/thjonusta` (39–79 þ.kr./mán) are placeholders marked DRAFT until Halli confirms.
- `APP_URL`/canonical host still references hallismiley.is in places — intentional until orangesmiley.is is registered; tracked in PLAN.md.
- Log surprises in `LESSONS.md` (tagged factory/base/project) so `/retro` can harvest them.

## Design rules (Halli, 2026-08-09 — binding for all UI work)

- **Banned defaults.** Fonts: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Arial, system-ui, Space Grotesk — not even in fallback stacks (use bare `serif`/`sans-serif`/`monospace` tails behind the self-hosted faces). Colors: purple/indigo/violet gradients, timid evenly-spread palettes, default Tailwind blue. Layout: centered hero + dual CTAs + three identical feature cards — the cookie-cutter SaaS shell.
- **Palette discipline.** One dominant color + one sharp accent + neutrals, all through the CSS token system. Here (the **Bjart** default since 2026-08-20, Halli's call): orange / black / white only — the orange ramp dominates (`--gold-light/--gold/--gold-dark` = #EA580C/#C2410C/#9A3412), near-black `--teal` is the sharp accent used sparingly, white and whisper-grey are the neutrals. **`--gold-light` is decorative-only on a light page (3.41 : 1)** — accent-coloured TEXT must use `--accent-ink`.
- **Make unexpected, context-specific choices.** The default is Bjart — white paper, black ink, one orange, Barlow voice, a themed gradient hero (the waterfall video is retired to an opt-in admin mode), the 4.1 emblem mark unchanged. **Five themes** live in the picker (`themes.css`): `classic`/Bjart (light default) · `light`/Pappír (warm ivory) · `mono` (b/w, orange on actions only) · `ember`/Glóð (the former Ash dark, values intact) · `midnight` (true black + bright orange). Halli picks themes by testing them live, so keep the picker healthy. When a row of cards is unavoidable, differentiate them (numbering, emphasis, asymmetry).

## Iceland scene engine ("Úti á Íslandi", 2026-08-21 — INNER PAGES only since 2026-08-22)

The public INNER pages live inside photographic Icelandic landscapes (Halli's
directive: the visitor should feel like they are outside in Iceland). Built in
three chunks on master; the engine is `public/js/scenes/` + `iceland-scene.css`.
**The homepage left the program on 2026-08-22**: Halli rejected the hard
cutovers between the home scene bands and reverted the home page to the
original hallismiley composition (see next section). The engine, ambience and
inner-page scenes are untouched.

- **Photos are licensed, never Halli's Facebook saves** — those were the mood
  board only. Shipped photos come from Wikimedia Commons (CC0/CC BY), credited
  in the generated `public/assets/iceland/CREDITS.md` (linked from the footer —
  CC BY requires it). Originals in gitignored `assets-src/iceland/` +
  `SOURCES.json`; `node scripts/build-iceland-scenes.js` regenerates all
  renditions/manifests and FAILS if a hero AVIF exceeds the 250KB LCP budget.
- **Scene assignments mean something** (sceneDefs.js): /thjonusta =
  Sigöldugljúfur (many falls, one river); /verkefni = Landmannalaugar (brand
  as landscape); /um-okkur = glacier at blue hour; /hafa-samband =
  Reynisfjara. (home/tiers/steps defs remain for the dormant home scenes.)
  Five themes grade the same photos via `--scene-*` tokens (mono = full
  grayscale).
- **Live ambience, on by default**: `/api/v1/ambience` proxies Open-Meteo
  (10-min server cache, ALWAYS 200 — failure is `{available:false}` and static
  scenes); real sun position computed client-side (sun.js — midnight sun falls
  out of the math); weather particles + WebGL aurora (dark themes at real
  night, CSS fallback); synthesized waterfall sound OFF by default. Toggles in
  the ThemeSwitcher (`ws_ambience`, `ws_ambience_sound`); everything obeys
  `utils/motion.js` (reduced-motion + Save-Data) and pauses off-screen/hidden.
- **landing_background mode 'video' is the hero default again** (migration
  089 reverted 086's one-day scene default); scene/gradient/photo/plain
  remain admin-selectable. SPA navigation uses View Transitions where
  supported (router.js); `.view` fadeIn is reduced-motion-gated and
  suppressed during VT.

## Homepage = the hallismiley composition (2026-08-22)

Halli's call: revert all the way back to the Halli Smiley homepage layout and
iterate from there — **dark waterfall-video hero, light Bjart site** below it.
`HomeView` renders hero → news → projects → skills → stats → contact →
footer again; the business `_tiers()`/`_steps()` sections (and the scene
band mount) are the dormant methods now, kept with their i18n for the coming
content pass. The media-hero surfaces are fixed dark on EVERY theme by design
(home.css — the veil's bottom stop alone hands off to the themed page), which
satisfies invariant 15 by construction. Content still wearing carpentry-era
copy (skills/stats rows, Unsplash discipline placeholders, contact page) is
Halli's content pass, not a bug.

## Factory commands

`/status` · `/base-diff` (engine drift vs base HEAD) · `/test-plan` · `/audit` · `/retro` · `/e2e` · `/i18n-sync` — plus base commands `/security-check`, `/pre-deploy`, `/migration-new`. (`/strip-base`, `/clone-ui`, `/import-data` exist but do not apply to this build — see the warning above.)

## Build status (three jobs, in order)

- [x] Job 1 — scaffold with all features (no strip), env fixes, this file, acceptance green
- [x] Job 2 — re-skin + re-organize, merged in seven chunks: B (IS default locale) → A (orange brand) → C (business IA) → D (hide portfolio surfaces) → E (lead capture) → F (SEO/JSON-LD + a11y) → G (business-routes e2e). 2012 Jest + 109 Playwright green.
- [x] Job 3 — `ENHANCEMENTS.md` written. **Stopped for Halli's approval — implement nothing from it until he says so.**

## Self-update module (built 2026-08-10, six phases, merged to master `64457ef`)

The fleet update mechanism: release channel published by CI, in-app checker,
apply/verify, admin screen at `/admin/updates`. Full architecture and the
provisioning items that are NOT code: `docs/SELF-UPDATE.md`. **Upstream status
(verified 2026-08-22): the base ALREADY has the whole module** — its own PR
#134 (migration 082_system_updates, ship-dark `enabled:false` default); the
old "documented but deliberately NOT performed" claim was stale. Only
`promote.yml` (channel publisher workflow) remained orangesmiley-only; its
base PR is prepared (see COMPANY-LOG 2026-08-22).

- `config/client.json` is the per-instance module config seam (defaults < file <
  `CLIENT_CONFIG_*` env). Every future module flag should read from it.
- This instance is `managed` on `stable`: it records updates and installs
  nothing. It has no `SELF_UPDATE_TRIGGER_URL`, so it could not install one yet.
- New invariant #14 (expand/contract migrations) — self-update is why.

## Base-sync 2026-08-19 (the base-upgrade program)

Four waves of engine features landed on master the same day they landed in
HalliProjects (ledger: site-factory/BASE-SYNC.md 2026-08-19). The program is
CLOSED — all 13 base PRs merged and deployed, base back to read-only:

- **6A security**: transactional+locked migration runner, UPLOAD_ROOT boot
  guard, upload-path allowlists, FB auto-link takeover refusal, CSP
  frameAncestors, PG TLS default-on, log secret-scrubbing, uploaded-avatar
  owner-scoping, **admin TOTP** (migration 082_admin_totp; enrol from the
  profile), OAuth-admin refusal, social-login kill switch (**OFF here** — no
  OAuth app configured), TEST-chrome one-way clamp.
- **6B stack**: Node 24 LTS (digest-pinned), Express 5 (catch-all +
  IndexNow-route idioms fixed), CI boot smoke declares UPLOAD_ROOT+DB_SSL.
- **6C theme**: per-account UI theme as migration 083_user_theme, adapted to
  the 2-theme palette (classic/light); Appearance section in the profile.
- **6D nav tints + CI**: admin-nav 12-tint row colours (rides the existing
  admin_nav_config JSONB, no migration) + Playwright CI hardening. A ported
  CSS hunk initially hid the admin sidebar at all widths (rule appended
  outside its @media block — fixed same day, see LESSONS.md 2026-08-19).

The migration chain now ends 080_background_sections · 081_system_updates ·
082_admin_totp · 083_user_theme. NEVER adopt the base's numbering for the
same features (it uses 080/081/082 for totp/theme/system_updates).

## Harvest 2026-08-22 (icelandicstore → here + base)

Five chunks merged on master + five base PRs (#136–#140); full ledger entry in site-factory/BASE-SYNC.md. Highlights here: Tier-1 fixes (cached-user, memory-alert, loud mail + EMAIL_ALLOWLIST, nav-saver races, CORP brand exemption, role-SET 2FA/OAuth gates via utils/adminRole.js); ISOLATED per-branch e2e DBs (e2e/lib/dbUrl.js — local e2e used to write into the dev DB); status-token completion + chartTheme.js + invariant 15; Admin → Monitoring (event_logs = migration 087, beacon, /admin/monitoring); MCP connector (mcp_tokens = 088, /admin/mcp, ships dark behind MCP_ENABLED) = ENHANCEMENTS #13 approved+implemented. Migration chain now ends 087_event_logs · 088_mcp_tokens. **HalliProjects is read-only again.** Ice back-port queue (when ITS window opens): role-SET gate fix, /auth/session totp_enabled.

## Where things stand for the next session

- **Company/product split decided 2026-08-22** (section above): next programs are R1 (company-site content pass HERE, copy needs Halli) and R2 (product-site build in the sibling `rekstrarkerfid` repo per `company/REKSTRARKERFI-BUILD-INSTRUCTIONS.md`). The base PR upstreaming `promote.yml` is prepared, pending Halli.
- **Awaiting Halli**: the 13 proposals in `ENHANCEMENTS.md` (#13, the MCP connector, added 2026-08-15), all DRAFT copy in the locale files, and the tier prices on `/thjonusta`. (#5 client.config and #7 portal are now roadmap items R4/R6 — still not implemented without his sign-off.)
- **Push-safe since 2026-08-19**: ENHANCEMENTS #1 is done — `deploy.yml` is dispatch-only with all targets in unset repo variables (guard step fails fast). Arming a real deploy = set the `vars.*` on the GitHub repo; no workflow edit.
- Public IA is `/`, `/thjonusta`, `/verkefni`, `/um-okkur`, `/hafa-samband`, `/personuvernd`. Everything else (party, bio, news, shop, and the `/projects` · `/contact` · `/privacy` aliases) is listed in `server/config/publicSurface.js`: hidden from nav, sitemap and search, still fully functional at its URL.
- Lighthouse desktop: SEO 100 and a11y 100 across the business routes; performance ~85 (home) / ~92 (`/thjonusta`). The gap is the router importing all 58 view modules eagerly — ENHANCEMENTS proposal #6.
